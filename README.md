This is an example of using magma to build a state machine application, specifically a regular expression (regex) matcher. The `Matcher` module provides a complete regex matcher circuit which takes in a new character each cycle and outputs whether or not there has been a substring match with a given regex. Running `python matcher_test.py` will execute a simple test using this circuit. See `matcher_test.py` for more details on using the `Matcher` module.
